NAME
    Module::Install::AggressiveInclude - A more aggressive include

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    At times Module::Install's include() function may not be enough for you.
    In that case Module::Install::AggressiveInclude may be what you need.

    Often for local development I tend to shy away from installing packages
    I may be working on so when working with packages that have multiple
    local dependencies I find my self writing this Makefile.PL code a lot:

        # use lib for my local libraries somewhere around here
        # ...
    
        build_requires 'Module::Find';
        require Module::Find;
    
        include 'FooPackage';
        include $_ foreach Module::Find::findallmod 'FooPackage::*';
    
        # so on and so forth

    Why? You may ask when Module::Install has a support for glob matching of
    packages. Well, because for my (and maybe yours) it is not powerful
    enough when it comes to deep includes.

    For example say we have a lot of modules we want to include from the
    same namespace:

        FooPackage
        FooPackage::Alpha
        FooPackage::Alpha::I
        FooPackage::Alpha::II
        FooPackage::Beta
        FooPackage::Beta::I
        FooPackage::Beta::II
        FooPackage::Gamma
        FooPackage::Gamma::I
        FooPackage::Gamma::II

    If we use Module::Install's include function like this:

        include 'FooPackage::*';

    Only these packages will get included:

        FooPackage::Alpha
        FooPackage::Beta
        FooPackage::Gamma
        # Not even plain ol' FooPackage is included

    In my opinion this lacks some DWIM functionality. So instead we do:

        include_aggressive 'FooPackage';

    And we will get the base package as well as every class under it's
    namespace.
