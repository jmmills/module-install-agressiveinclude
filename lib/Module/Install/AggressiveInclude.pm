=head1 NAME

Module::Install::AggressiveInclude - A more aggressive include

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

At times L<Module::Install>'s include() function may not be enough for you.
In that case L<Module::Install::AggressiveInclude> may be what you need.

Often for local development I tend to shy away from installing packages I may
be working on so when working with packages that have multiple local
dependencies I find my self writing this Makefile.PL code a lot:

    # use lib for my local libraries somewhere around here
    # ...

    build_requires 'Module::Find';
    require Module::Find;

    include 'FooPackage';
    include $_ foreach Module::Find::findallmod 'FooPackage::*';

    # so on and so forth

Why? You may ask when L<Module::Install> has a support for glob matching of
packages. Well, because for my (and maybe yours) it is not powerful enough
when it comes to deep includes.

For example say we have a lot of modules we want to include from the same
namespace:

    FooPackage
    FooPackage::Alpha
    FooPackage::Alpha::I
    FooPackage::Alpha::II
    FooPackage::Beta
    FooPackage::Beta::I
    FooPackage::Beta::II
    FooPackage::Gamma
    FooPackage::Gamma::I
    FooPackage::Gamma::II

If we use L<Module::Install>'s include function like this:

    include 'FooPackage::*';

Only these packages will get included:

    FooPackage::Alpha
    FooPackage::Beta
    FooPackage::Gamma
    # Not even plain ol' FooPackage is included

In my opinion this lacks some DWIM functionality.
So instead we do:

    include_aggressive 'FooPackage';

And we will get the base package as well as every class under it's namespace.
